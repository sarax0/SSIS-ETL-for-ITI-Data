## Overview
Welcome to the ITI Data Integration with SSIS repository! This space documents my journey through various SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) exercises, focusing on Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes. Here, I showcase my expertise in integrating ITI data using SSIS and implementing ETL methodologies effectively.

This dataset includes student records, course details, topics, departmental data, and instructor profiles.

Throughout this repository, I explore managing and transforming student records, course data, departmental information, and instructor profiles using SSIS. By focusing on data accuracy and consistency, I highlight the role of SSIS in optimizing educational administrative processes within institutions like ITI.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this lab is to demonstrate my proficiency in ETL processes using SSIS, a robust tool provided by Microsoft for data integration and workflow automation. Through these exercises, I aim to:
- Illustrate my understanding of ETL concepts and methodologies.
- Showcase my ability to extract data from multiple sources, transform it according to business requirements, and load it into destination systems.
- Highlight my skills in leveraging SSIS for data integration tasks.

## Lab Details
### 1. Transfer Department Data
- Designed SSIS packages to transfer department data from the ITI DB to a new DB named "Test", emphasizing data integrity and consistency.
- Implemented truncation of the destination table ("Department") before data transfer to ensure clean data loading.

### 2. Export Student Data to Delimited File
- Developed SSIS packages to export student data (St_id, St_Fname, St_lname, St_address) from the ITI DB to delimited files, adhering to ETL principles.
- Set column names as the first row in the files to maintain data structure consistency.

### 3. Transfer and Transform Student Data
- Designed SSIS packages to transfer and transform student data from the ITI DB to the "Test" DB:
  - Merged first name and last name into a single field ("Full name") to enhance data readability.
  - Implemented error handling mechanisms and performed full database backups for data integrity assurance.

### 4. Split and Process Course Data
- Created SSIS packages to split and process course data from the ITI DB based on duration:
  - Segregated course data into multiple files based on duration criteria, ensuring efficient data organization.
  - Applied sorting and transformation techniques to prepare data for downstream analysis and reporting.

### 5. Merge and Union of Files
- Attempted to merge and unionize files using SSIS components:
  - Merged and unionized files to consolidate data for further analysis and decision-making processes.
